testing modification capability
trying to automate
trying time commit message
executing the bat file with cmd
error with no new commit
running on script with powershell
works with command line pasted directly into powershell
not working with bat file
changed to ps1 extension
added @echo off & powershell -command "" to beginning of powershell command
the bat worked, maybe because of time restriction. changed message to autoupdate.
